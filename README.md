# PasswordGenerator



Purpose

I carried out this project because data breaches are becoming more severe and frequent each year. Weak and reused passwords are one of the main causes of compromised accounts. To help address this issue, I developed a Python-based Random Password Generator. The tool enables users to create strong, unpredictable passwords using a mix of characters, improving their online security and reducing the risk of password-related breaches.

Inspiration/Why I Made It

I created this project because data breaches are a serious and growing concern. Many people fall victim to cyberattacks simply because they don’t update their passwords regularly or continue using weak, easy-to-guess credentials. I wanted to develop a tool that not only generates strong, random passwords but also encourages better password habits to help protect users’ personal data and accounts online.

Key Skills & Technologies Used

I used HTML so that I can open the password generator in a web browser as this general makes it more accessible and user friendly. CSS was used for styling as it allows the users to see where they can click as its essentially the graphic user interface. The backend logic for the generation of secure passwords was written in Python and I used random and string to ensure each password is very strong and not predictable.
